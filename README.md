Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis


The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Play Store is one of the largest and most popular android app stores with over a million apps. We were provided with Play Store data in the form of two raw datasets namely Play Store Data and App Reviews. The first one consisted of apps with details and the second dataset contained customer reviews of apps. We focused more on the first dataset i.e apps data because it contained more and useful data than reviews dataset.

Problem Statement:
Our aim was to analyze the data and find out the factors responsible for app engagement and success. First we tried to know how it is classified whether the app is successful or not. We considered that apps with high ratings, reviews and number of installs are said to be successful. So our approach was to find how these parameters contribute to app success and what features influence the ratings, reviews and number of installs.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
We have performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on this dataset to gain useful insights. EDA is a lengthy process consisting of different steps. There is no one common method to perform EDA, it depends on the dataset we are working with. To carry out Exploratory Data Analysis, we used Python as a programming language and Google Colab to write and execute code.

Methodology:
Our analysis is divided into three phases; understanding data, data preparation and data visualization.

This involved various steps:

Importing libraries and dataset
Cleaning and preparing the data
Extracting essential data from the dataset
Exploratory analysis and visualizations
